    "**Global variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to access from any part of the code without needing to pass them as arguments.\n",
    "- Can help reduce the number of arguments a function needs, making the function signature simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, as any part of the code can modify the global variable.\n",
    "- Makes code harder to understand and maintain, as it's not clear which functions rely on or modify the global variable.\n",
    "- Less modular and harder to reuse functions in other programs, since they depend on the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passing by reference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes code more modular, as functions explicitly state in their signature what variables they need.\n",
    "- Easier to understand, maintain, and reuse, as it's clear which functions use or modify the variable.\n",
    "- Better encapsulation, as each function deals only with the data it needs.\n",

    "- Slightly more complex to work with, as you need to pass the variable explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding memory and performance, there is generally not a significant difference between using global variables and passing variables by reference. In both cases, the memory used for the variable is allocated once and accessed by reference, so there is no additional memory overhead. The performance depends on the specific use case and how well the code is optimized.\n",
