      - handling **missing** values
        - | STRUCTURED |
          - a - **deleting** rows

    - Exploratory Data Analysis ==[ EDA ]==
      - | NLP |
        - 🎶 { vocabulary **generation** } 🎶
          - **Tokenization**
            - split the text into individual tokens (words)

              - ```python
                  text = "The cat sat on the mat."
                  tokens = word_tokenize(text)
                ```

                - tokens == `["The", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat", "."]`
          - **Lowercasing**
            - lower case all characters in a word to consolidate
              - `"The" == "the"`

              - ```python
                  tokens = [w.lower() for w in tokens]
                ```

          - **Removing** Stop Words and Punctuations
            - **remove** words and punctuations that don't **add meaning**
              - example : "the", "a", "an"

              - ```python
                  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
                  tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w in stop_words and w not in string.punctuation]
                ```

          - **Stemming/Lemmatization**
            - consolidate words to their root forms
              - `"running" -> "run"`

              - ```python
                  ps = PorterStemmer()
                  tokens = [ps.stem(w) for w in tokens]
                ```

          - **Creating Vocabulary**
            - each vocab is assigned a UID
              - because models work with numerical values not text

              - ```python
                  vocabulary = set(tokens)
                ```

## -- CONCEPTS --

### | GRADIENT |

- ->> 🔑 key challenges <<- 📶
  - -- bounds --
    - **vanishing gradient**
    - **exploding gradient**

#### -- RESNETS --

- a family of **2015** neural network architectures
  - from the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"
  - 🔑 **key** innovation of **ResNet**
    - introduction of **residual blocks**
    - with **skip connections** (or shortcuts) 📶
      - 1 - allow the network to **skip** one or more **layers in the forward pass**
      - 2 - effectively allowing the network to **learn identity functions**
        - ☑️ @udit-ok : Explain what identity functions are
          - | ANSWER |
            - `f(x) = x`
              - **pass-through op**
                - **output==input**, so the current layer can be **skipped**
                - gives the **network** the option to carry **information forward** directly
                  - as a result the gradient are preserved (so that it doesn't vanish)
                  - | EXAMPLE |
                    - 1 - empty PhotoShop Layer
                    - 2 - vertex shade based on vtx height
                      - **shader graph** where blade of **grass** darker at the root
      - 3 - tackles the problem of **vanishing gradients**
        - **vanishing gradients** make it hard for the network to
        learn and adjust the **parameters** of the **earlier layers**
      - 4 -makes it possible to train much deeper networks
        - adding extra layers won't harm network perf, because they can be pass-through

##### | RESIDUAL BLOCKS |

###### CONVOLUTIONS

- **image processing** - where
  - **kernel** (filter) is applied to **analyize** an image
    - **capturing features** such as
      - 1 - edges
      - 2 - textures
      - 3 - ...etc

- ==**@ Feature Maps @**==
  - **output of the layers** in a neural network
    - **filtered** versions of the **input** data
      - where each map represents the **regions** in the input
      - that **activated** certain **features learned** by the **network**
  - -- parameters --
    - **Stride**
      - defines distance that a **kernel** slides over an **area** of the image
        - 1 - and performs a **calculation at each position**
        - 2 - **generates** a new **feature map** as **output**
    - **1x1 Convolution**

- ==**@ LOD @**==
  - | CNN |
    - **Stride**
      - **# of pixels**
      - the **kernel** of a convolution
      - **moves**
        - at each **step**
          - if **stride==1**
            - convolution filter xforms 1 pixel at a time, **analyzing every input pixel**
          - if **stride==2**
            - the `size` of the **output feature map** will be `half` the input
              - because convolution filter **jumps** 2 pixels at a time
              - this is effectively the equivalent of `1 LOD`
            - **efficiently** speed up **time** and reduce memory **size**
              - **trade-off** is loss in finer **detail** of the output image
  - vs MIPMAPS
    - | GFX |
      - **Mipmaps**
        - **sequence** of textures
          - each are progressively **lower resolution**
          - representations of the **same image**
        - GPU `selects` an `LOD` given `distance` and rotation `angle`
          - to reduce computational load
          - and visual artifact
    - -- **similarities** --
      - both stride and mipmaps are **techniques** to
      **reduce computational** complexity
      - both trade-off some **level of detail** to gain **efficiency**
    - -- **differences** --
      - **stride** is used for cnn image processing as **data analysis**
        - adjusts feature output by **skipping pixels during convolution**
        - stride parameter affects **model training performance** and accuracy
      - **mipmaps** are used for 3D **image rendering**
        - **pregenerates LOD** maps at multiple resolutions of the **same texture**
          - stride of 2 == 1 LOD
          - ☑️ @udit-ok : chatGPT suggests that mipmaps don't downscale by applying convolution
            - this is FALSE in that may be accurate by CONVENTION
              - downscale options are only limited by engineering attention
        - mipmap affects **runtime performance and visual quality**

###### SKIP CONNECTIONS

- enables **DEEPER** Networks
  - handles the **vanishing gradients** problem
    - because it allows the network to skip one or more layers in the forward pass
    - effectively allowing the network to learn the identity function?
  - **slides** persist the **earlier layers**
- -- **Gradient Vanishing** --
  - to prevent gradient vanishing
    - 1 - Direct Path for Gradient Flow
      - reduce gradient xform via a direct flow **from output to earlier layers***
      - during **backpropagation**
    - 2 - Residual Learning
      - learning **residual vs complete** function
        - residual == difference between input and output
        - **residual is closer to identity** function
- -- Trade-Offs -- 📶
  - | Benefits |
    - 1 - Mitigates **Vanishing Gradient** Problem
    - 2 - Enable **Identity Learning**
    - 3 - **Reduces** Overfitting
  - | DrawBacks |
    - 1 - Design Complexity
      - **Tabular** Data
        - GBM (Gradient Boosting Machines) have been shown to perform better
        - And are SIMPLER
          - It's UNCLEAR the value of a more complex model with skip connection brings
      - **Small Networks**
        - risk of vanishing gradient are reduced
          - as a result the value of skip connection are also reduced
    - 2 - **Not Universally Effective** across Network Types
      - **autoencoders**
        - Types
          - 1 - generative
          - 2 - dimensionality reduction
          - 3 - anomaly detection
        - skip connections could allow these model to bypass the **bottleneck layer**
          - defeating the purpose of these architecture
      - **temporal dynamic networks** such as **RNN**
        - effectiveness is **unclear**
    - 3 - Risk of OverFitting

            - machine translation or text summarization
        - 5 - **Reinforcement Learning (Policy Gradient Methods)**
          - output of the model represents the probability of taking each action
            - In reinforcement learning, specifically policy gradient methods, the
            model (also known as the agent) learns a policy, which is a probability
            distribution over actions given the current state

            - ☑️ @udit-ok : Explain why we MUST inline get_x and get_y functions as opposed to using lambdas?

              - ```python
                  dblock = DataBlock(get_x=lambda r:r['fname'], get_y=lambda r:r['labels'])
                ```

              - ANSWER:
                - During **iterative** training of the **Learner**, it's essential to be able
                to save (write) and load (read) the status of 'fname' and 'labels',
                a process known as **serialization**
                  - However, for serialization to work effectively, the functions passed to **get_x** and **get_y** must have specific, indexable **names**
                  - **Lambda** functions are **anonymous** and **do NOT** have a specific and **indexable name**, which makes them unsuitable for serialization
                  - Therefore to ensure **serialization**, we MUST use properly **named functions** instead of lambda functions
                  - This will allow us to save and load **Learner** states without issues
            - **returns**

                    - | ANSWER |
                      - When a model assigns a prediction probability of 0.5
                        - it's essentially saying it's **UNSURE** about the prediction
                          - This isn't an ideal prediction but ...
                          - CONFIDENTLY predicting the WRONG class is WORSE by far
                        - if the model consistently assigns a probability of around 0.5 to the correct class
                          - (indicating it's unsure about many of its predictions)
                          - it's a sign that the model is **struggling** to **learn patterns** from the data
                          - This could be due to many reasons such as 📶
                            - 1 - not enough training data
                            - 2 - the model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data
                            - 3 - the features used do not contain enough information to make accurate predictions
                          - To **improve performance** may be necessary to revisit : 📶
                            - 1 - the model's architecture
                            - 2 - the data
                            - 3 - the training process to
                      - Whether the model will **converge**
                        - (i.e., learn to make correct predictions)
                        - depends on many factors beyond this single prediction : 📶
                          - 1 - how the model performs on the other data points
                          - 2 - the complexity of the model

                - ☑️ @udit-ok : what are the REASONS to use -log function to translate probabilities?
                  - ANSWER : 📶
                    - 1 - Express Uncertainty
                      - **log(p)** function **INCREASES** as the probability **p** **DECREASES**
                      - **LOWER probability** events are associated with **LARGER output**
                        - results in capturing **higher SURPRISE**
                        - **punishes CERTAINTY** when WRONG
                    - 2 - Numerical Stability
                      - **numerical underflow** is when extremely small numbers are INCORRECTLY rounded to ZERO
                      - **log xforms** small values outside of **rounding threshold**
                    - 3 - Transforms Product into Sums
                      - in **logaritmic space**, multiplication becomes **addition**
                      - reduces **underflow** since multiplying small numbers yield increasingly smaller numbers
                    - 4 - Loss Function in Machine Learning
                      - **cross entropy loss** is used by classification tasks

  - -- FINE TUNE --

    - ```python
        learn.fine_tune(3, base_lr=3e-3, freeze_epocs=4)
      ```

      - **.fine_tune()** a pre-trained model on a specific task
        - fine_tuning pretrained model **benefits** include
          - 1 - **Transfer of Learning**
            - **build features** on existing **base layers** and **vocabulary**
              - **images** : edges, shapes, colors and textures
              - **text** : grammar, syntax, semantics (breathe)
          - 2 - **Efficiency**
            - if **no discernable difference** in base if we retrain from scratch, why do it???
            - just **fine_tune** the **existing work** instead!!!
        - fine_tuning pretrained model **pitfalls** include 📶
          - 1 - **Domain Mismatch**
            - if base layers **lack overlap** with the **model task**
              - the model's **task is unique** enough to FULLY TRAIN a NEW MODEL
          - 2 - **Overfitting**
            - if **dataset is small**, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model can lead to overfitting
              - performs well on **training** data
              - but FAILS to GENERALIZE to **production** data
          - 3 - **Catastropic Forgetting**
            - if model is fine-tuned **too aggressively** (high learning rate)
              - catastrophic forgetting is when a model **unlearn** the useful features of the **pretraining** model
                - the base layers are mutated!!!
          - 4 - **Ethical and Bias Considerations**
      - ( ... )
        - **epoch** is **one complete pass** through the entire training dataset
          - '3'
        - **base_lr=3e-3**
          - **base learning rate** used for fine-tuning
          - learning rate controls the step size during gradient descent
            - smaller rate
              - learns slower and requires more epoch
              - potentially more precise results
            - larger rate
              - learns quickly in less epoch
              - might overshoot optimal solution
        - **freeze_epochs=4**
          - number of **epochs** for which to train the model while the **body is frozen**
            - (all layers except the head)
            - When the body is frozen, the weights in those layers are not updated
            - This allows the new layers (the head) to learn some reasonable weights from the outset, before the entire model is fine-tuned
      - { ... }
        - fine_tune function is a two-step process
          - 1 - trains only the randomly initialized head of the model for freeze_epochs epochs,
          while keeping the pre-trained body of the model frozen
            - This allows the head to learn some weights from the data
            without disturbing the pre-trained weights of the body too much
          - 2 - unfreezes the entire model and continues training for the specified number of epochs,
          fine-tuning the pre-trained weights to the specific task
        - optimized model matters!
