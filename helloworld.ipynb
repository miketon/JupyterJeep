It uses the environments provided by conda or venv.\n","Pip installs Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n","Pip cannot install conda packages, only Python packages.\n","Pip comes bundled with all versions of Python >= 2.7.9 and >= 3.4.\n","\n","Some key points:\n","\n","Conda is a language-agnostic package manager and environment manager. \n","Pip is a package manager for Python packages. \n","Conda can install both conda packages and pip packages. \n","Pip can only install pip packages.\n","\n","In practice:\n","\n","Use conda to install any package or create/manage environments. \n","Use pip to install Python packages within a conda environment. \n","Never use pip to install packages into the base conda environment.\n","\n","A visual summary:\n","\n","Conda: Package Manager + Environment Manager\n","   |- Conda packages (language-agnostic)\n","   |- Pip packages (Python) \n","Pip: Package Manager (Python)\n","\n","So pip is suitable for Python projects, while conda is suitable for projects that use multiple languages.

Line magics are single-line commands that are interpreted by the IPython kernel, not the Python interpreter. In this case, `%pip` is a built-in magic command that runs the `pip` package manager within the context of the current Jupyter Notebook kernel. This command installs the Bokeh package in the same Python environment used by the current kernel.\n","\n","2. `!pip install Bokeh`: This command starts with an exclamation mark `!`, which is used to run shell commands directly from the Jupyter Notebook cell. When you use an exclamation mark, the command is executed in a new shell process outside of the IPython kernel. In this case, the `!pip install Bokeh` command runs the `pip` package manager to install the Bokeh package. Depending on your system configuration and paths, this command may install the package in a different Python environment from the one used by your Jupyter Notebook kernel.\n","\n","In most cases, both commands will install the Bokeh package as expected, and you can use it in your Jupyter Notebook. However, it's generally recommended to use the `%pip` magic command (`%pip install Bokeh`) to ensure that the package is installed in the same environment as the Jupyter Notebook kernel. This way, you can avoid potential issues related to multiple Python environments or configurations."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.13 ('torch-gpu')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"0203b3654eb8bc60da03d36108deed569263a68c1ed718ab77fdacb38634fa76"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
