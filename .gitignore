Cargo.lock

To write a `.gitignore` entry for Rust target folders, you'll want to add the following lines to your `.gitignore` file:

```
# Rust
# 1. `/target` ignores the `target` directory at the root of your project. This 
# is where build artifacts, such as executables and object files, are stored by 
# default when you run `cargo build`.
/target
# 2. `**/target` ignores any `target` directories in subdirectories of your 
# project (useful for workspaces or projects with nested crates).
**/target
# 3. `Cargo.lock` ignores the `Cargo.lock` file. This file is auto-generated by 
# Cargo and contains dependency version information. You may want to include it 
# in your repository for binary projects to ensure reproducible builds, but for 
# libraries, it's common to add it to `.gitignore`.
Cargo.locka
