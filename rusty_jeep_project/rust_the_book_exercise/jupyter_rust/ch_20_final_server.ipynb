    "\n",
    "We’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin,  \n",
    "let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web  \n",
    "servers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but  \n",
    "a brief overview will give you the information you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main protocols involved in web servers are Hypertext Transfer Protocol  \n",
    "(HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Both protocols are  \n",
    "request-response protocols, meaning a client initiates requests and a server  \n",
    "listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The contents of  \n",
    "those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information  \n",
    "gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that information is.  \n",
    "HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and  \n",
    "responses. It’s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in  \n",
