    "\n",
    "We’ll start by getting a single-threaded web server working. Before we begin,  \n",
    "let’s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web  \n",

    "#### -- Protocols : HTTP and TCP --\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main protocols involved in web servers are Hypertext Transfer Protocol  \n",
    "(HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Both protocols are  \n",
    "request-response protocols, meaning a client initiates requests and a server  \n",

    "those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.\n",

    "TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information  \n",
    "gets from one server to another but doesn’t specify what that information is.  \n",
    "HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and  \n",

    "### Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread pool is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready to  \n",
    "handle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the  \n",
    "threads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The  \n",
    "remaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come  \n",
    "in while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done  \n",
    "processing its task, it’s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle  \n",
    "a new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,  \n",
    "increasing the throughput of your server.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to protect us  \n",
    "from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program create a new thread  \n",
    "for each request as it came in, someone making 10 million requests to our  \n",
    "server could create havoc by using up all our server’s resources and grinding  \n",
    "the processing of requests to a halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we’ll have a fixed number of  \n",
    "threads waiting in the pool. Requests that come in are sent to the pool for  \n",
    "processing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the  \n",
    "threads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request,  \n",
    "and then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process up  \n",
    "to N requests concurrently, where N is the number of threads. If each thread is  \n",
    "responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still back up in  \n",
    "the queue, but we’ve increased the number of long-running requests we can  \n",
    "handle before reaching that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a web  \n",
    "server. Other options you might explore are the fork/join model, the  \n",
