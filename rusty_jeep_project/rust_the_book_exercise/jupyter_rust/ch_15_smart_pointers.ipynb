    "pointer in Rust is a reference, which you learned about in Chapter 4. References  \n",
    "are indicated by the & symbol and borrow the value they point to. They don’t  \n",
    "have any special capabilities other than referring to data, and have no overhead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart pointers, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer  \n",
    "but also have additional metadata and capabilities. The concept of smart  \n",
    "pointers isn’t unique to Rust: smart pointers originated in C++ and exist in  \n",
    "other languages as well. Rust has a variety of smart pointers defined in the  \n",
    "standard library that provide functionality beyond that provided by references.  \n",
    "To explore the general concept, we’ll look at a couple of different examples of  \n",
    "smart pointers, including a reference counting smart pointer type. This pointer  \n",
    "enables you to allow data to have multiple owners by keeping track of the number  \n",
    "of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, has an additional difference  \n",
    "between references and smart pointers: while references only borrow data, in  \n",
    "many cases, smart pointers own the data they point to.  "
