    "What is Ownership?\n",
    "---\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.  \n",
    "All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.  \n",
    "Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used  \n",
    "memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly  \n",
    "allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed  \n",
    "through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.  \n",
    "If any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the  \n",
    "features of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time  \n",
    "to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust  \n",
    "and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally  \n",
    "develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding  \n",
    "the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by  \n",

    "### Stack and Heap\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the  \n",
    "heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a  \n",
    "value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why you  \n",
    "have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in relation  \n",
    "to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief explanation  \n",
    "in preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use at  \n",
    "runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores values in  \n",
    "the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is  \n",
    "referred to as last in, first out. Think of a stack of plates: when you add more  \n",
    "plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one  \n",
    "off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work  \n",
    "as well! Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is  \n",
    "called popping off the stack. All **`data stored on the stack`** must have a known,  \n",
    "**`fixed size`**. Data with an **`unknown size at compile time`** or a size that might  \n",
    "change must be **`stored on the heap`** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain  \n",
    "amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is  \n",
    "big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the  \n",
    "address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap and is  \n",
    "sometimes abbreviated as just allocating (pushing values onto the stack is not  \n",
    " considered allocating). Because the **`pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size,`**  \n",
    " you can **`store the pointer on the stack`**, but when you want the actual data, you  \n",
    " must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter,  \n",
    " you state the number of people in your group, and the host finds an empty table  \n",
    " that fits everyone and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late,  \n",
    " they can ask where you’ve been seated to find you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator  \n",
    "never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at  \n",
    "the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more    \n",
    "work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data  \n",
    "and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because  \n",
    "you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster  \n",
    "if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at  \n",
    "a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the  \n",
    "orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from  \n",
    "table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B  \n",
    "again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its  \n",
    "job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack)  \n",
    "rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including,  \n",
    "potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables  \n",
    "get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped  \n",
    "off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing  \n",
    "the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the  \n",
    "heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.  \n",
    "Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the stack and the  \n",
    "heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership is to manage  \n",
    "heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.\n"
