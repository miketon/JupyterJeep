    "\n",
    "We keep the assertion that the mid index is within the slice. Then we get to the  \n",
    "unsafe code: the slice::from_raw_parts_mut function takes a raw pointer and a  \n",
    "length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create a slice that  \n",

    "The function slice::from_raw_parts_mut is unsafe because it takes a raw pointer  \n",
