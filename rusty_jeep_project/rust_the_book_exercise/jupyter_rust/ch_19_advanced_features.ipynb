    "### Unsafe Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code we’ve discussed so far has had Rust’s memory safety guarantees  \n",
    "enforced at compile time. However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it  \n",
    "that doesn’t enforce these memory safety guarantees:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- it’s called unsafe Rust and works just like regular Rust, but gives us extra  \n",
    "superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Unsafe Rust`** exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative.  \n",
    "When the compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees,  \n",
    "it’s better for it to reject some valid programs than to accept some invalid  \n",
    "programs. Although the code might be okay, if the Rust compiler doesn’t have  \n",
    "enough information to be confident, it will reject the code. In these cases,  \n",
    "you can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, “Trust me, I know what I’m doing.”  \n",
    "Be warned, however, that you use unsafe Rust at your own risk:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- if you use unsafe code incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety,  \n",
    "such as null pointer dereferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer  \n",
    "hardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn’t let you do unsafe operations, you  \n",
    "couldn’t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems  \n",
    "programming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even  \n",
    "writing your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming is  \n",

    "In Chapter 4, in the “Dangling References” section, we mentioned that the  \n",

    "respectively. The asterisk isn’t the dereference operator; it’s part of the  \n",

    "Recall from “The Slice Type” section in Chapter 4 that slices are a pointer to  \n",
    "some data and the length of the slice. We use the len method to get the length  \n",
    "of a slice and the as_mut_ptr method to access the raw pointer of a slice. In  \n",
    "this case, because we have a mutable slice to i32 values, as_mut_ptr returns a  \n",
    "raw pointer with the type *mut i32, which we’ve stored in the variable ptr.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep the assertion that the mid index is within the slice. Then we get to the  \n",
    "unsafe code: the slice::from_raw_parts_mut function takes a raw pointer and a  \n",
    "length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create a slice that  \n",
    "starts from ptr and is mid items long. Then we call the add method on ptr with  \n",
    "mid as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at mid, and we create a  \n",
    "slice using that pointer and the remaining number of items after mid as the  \n",
    "length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function slice::from_raw_parts_mut is unsafe because it takes a raw pointer  \n",
    "and must trust that this pointer is valid. The add method on raw pointers is  \n",
    "also unsafe, because it must trust that the offset location is also a valid  \n",
    "pointer. Therefore, we had to put an unsafe block around our calls to  \n",
    "slice::from_raw_parts_mut and add so we could call them. By looking at the code  \n",
