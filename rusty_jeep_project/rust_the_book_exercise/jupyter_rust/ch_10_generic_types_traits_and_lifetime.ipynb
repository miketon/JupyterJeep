    "concepts. In Rust, one such tool is generics: abstract stand-ins for concrete  \n",
    "types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or how they  \n",
    "relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place when  \n",
    "compiling and running the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type  \n",
    "like i32 or String, in the same way a function takes parameters with unknown  \n",
    "values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we’ve already  \n",
    "used generics in Chapter 6 with Option<T>, Chapter 8 with Vec<T> and  \n",
    "HashMap<K, V>, and Chapter 9 with Result<T, E>. In this chapter, you’ll explore  \n",
    "how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. We’ll  \n",
    "then use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that  \n",
    "differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also explain how to use  \n",
    "generic types in struct and enum definitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you’ll learn how to use traits to define behavior in a generic way. You  \n",
    "can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept only  \n",
    "those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll discuss lifetimes: a variety of generics that give the compiler  \n",
    "information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes allow us to  \n",
    "give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that it can ensure  \n",
    "references will be valid in more situations than it could without our help.  "
