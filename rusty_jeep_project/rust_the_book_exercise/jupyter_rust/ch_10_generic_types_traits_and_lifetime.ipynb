    "Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication of  \n",
    "concepts. In Rust, one such tool is generics: abstract stand-ins for concrete  \n",
    "types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or how they  \n",
    "relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place when  \n",
    "compiling and running the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type  \n",
    "like i32 or String, in the same way a function takes parameters with unknown  \n",
    "values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we’ve already  \n",
    "used generics in Chapter 6 with Option<T>, Chapter 8 with Vec<T> and  \n",
    "HashMap<K, V>, and Chapter 9 with Result<T, E>. In this chapter, you’ll explore  \n",
    "how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. We’ll  \n",
    "then use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that  \n",
    "differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also explain how to use  \n",
    "generic types in struct and enum definitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you’ll learn how to use traits to define behavior in a generic way. You  \n",
    "can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept only  \n",
    "those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll discuss lifetimes: a variety of generics that give the compiler  \n",

    "give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that it can ensure  \n",

    "pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {\n",
    "    println!(\"Breaking news! {}\", item.summarize());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is  \n",

    "parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.\n"

    "The impl Trait syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple  \n",
    "cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other  \n",
    "cases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement Summary. Doing so  \n",
    "with the impl Trait syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using impl Trait is appropriate if we want this function to allow item1 and  \n",
    "item2 to have different types (as long as both types implement Summary). If we  \n",
    "want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use a  \n",
    "trait bound, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "> What if I want items to be of different types, using trait bounds style?\n",
