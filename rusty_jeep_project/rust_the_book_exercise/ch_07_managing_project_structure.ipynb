    "(as we did all the way back in the “Writing and Running a Rust Program” section  \n",
    "of Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates can  \n",
    "contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled  \n",
    "with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crate can come in one of two forms:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Binary crates`** are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run,  \n",
    "such as a command-line program or a server. Each must have a function called  \n",
    "main that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we’ve  \n",
    "created so far have been binary crates.\n",
    "- **`Library crates`** don’t have a main function, and they don’t compile to an  \n",
    "executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with  \n",
    "multiple projects. For example, the rand crate we used in Chapter 2 provides  \n",
    "functionality that generates random numbers. Most of the time when Rustaceans  \n",

    "the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an `Asparagus`  \n",
    "type in the garden vegetables module would be found at  \n",
    "`crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`.  \n",
    "- **`Private vs public:`** Code within a module is private from its parent  \n",
    "modules by default. To make a module public, declare it :  \n",
    "    - with `pub mod` instead of `mod.`  \n",
    "To make items within a public module public as well : \n",
    "    - use `pub` before their declarations.\n",
    "- **`The use keyword:`** Within a scope, the `use` keyword creates shortcuts to  \n",
    "items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to :  \n",
    "    - `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`,  \n",
