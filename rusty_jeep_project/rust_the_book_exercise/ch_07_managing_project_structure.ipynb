    "- **`Library crates`** don’t have a main function, and they don’t compile to an  \n",
    "executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with  \n",
    "multiple projects. For example, the rand crate we used in Chapter 2 provides  \n",

    "\n",
    "When `eat_at_restaurant()` is called, several things happen on the stack and  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. `eat_at_restaurant()` is called, and a new stack frame is created for this  \n",
    "function. The stack frame contains the local variables and function call information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `meal` variable is created on the stack. It is a mutable binding of type  \n",
    "`back_of_house::Breakfast`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `back_of_house::Breakfast::summer(\"Rye\")` is called. A new stack frame is  \n",
    "created for this method. The `toast` argument, a string slice `&str`, is pushed  \n",
    "onto the stack. The `&str` is a reference to the string literal \"Rye\" that is  \n",
    "stored in the read-only memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the `summer` method, a new `Breakfast` struct instance is created on  \n",
    "the heap. The `toast` field of the struct is assigned a new `String` created  \n",
    "from the input `toast` argument (`String::from(toast)`). This involves  \n",
    "allocating memory on the heap for the string and copying the characters from the  \n",
    "input string slice. The `seasonal_fruit` field is assigned a new `String`  \n",
    "created from the string literal \"peaches\".\n",
    "> Q : Is peach on the stack or the heap?\n",

    "> A : When the `seasonal_fruit` field is assigned a new `String` created from  \n",
    "the string literal \"peaches\", the memory for the `String` is allocated on the heap.\n",

    "is on the stack as part of the `Breakfast` struct, while the actual string data  \n",

    "frame for the method is popped. The `meal` variable on the stack now holds the  \n",
    "reference to the `Breakfast` instance on the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `meal.toast` field is updated with a new `String` created from the string  \n",
    "literal \"Wheat\". This involves allocating memory on the heap for the new string,  \n",
    "copying the characters, and updating the `meal.toast` reference to point to the  \n",
    "new string. The old \"Rye\" string on the heap is now orphaned and will be  \n",
    "deallocated by the Rust memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `println!` macro is called, which formats the output string and prints it  \n",
    "to the console. The string \"I'd like Wheat toast please\" is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `eat_at_restaurant()` function reaches its end, the stack frame is  \n",
