In the realm of fruits and the verdant green,
Lies a secret treasure, oft unseen.
The avocado's gift, a fleshy delight,
But lo, the skin too, holds power and might.

Rich in fiber, a textured embrace,
The outer layer, a healthy chase.
Antioxidants, they dance and play,
On the rugged surface, where nutrients lay.

Oh, avocado skin, your wonders we glean,
A trove of goodness, in the rough, unseen.
So next we savor this emerald prize,
We'll cherish the skin, and health, it supplies.

Despite it's gross and plasticky taste,
This opp for IMMORTALITY we can NOT WASTE!
Unlike the inner seed, poisonous and vile,
The skin will carry us on for many a mile!
