VSCode artifact where rust functions failed to compile code completion :
- can be fixed by loading the project at each sibling folder
- as opposed to the monolithic parent rusty_jeep_project parent folder

@todo : Figure out if this is because Rust projects expect
- dir/sr/ folder for each project
- or if this is because of the way VSCode handles Rust projects
