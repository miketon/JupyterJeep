- Most **important** part of a **Git repository**
  - It's what gets **copied** when you **clone a repository** from **remote**
    - Hidden directory in a Git repository that contains

    - (compressed and stored by their SHA1 hash)
      - directory **stores all** the **content** for your

    - -- DEPRECATED --
      - is no longer used for new repositories
      - used by early versions of Git to hold references to heads of branches
      - @audit : verify that this is TRUE!

  - description
    - `Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the repository.
      - repro description
        - file is only used by the **GitWeb** program, so you can **safely ignore** it

    - üÜó @udit-ok üÜó : Explain this
    - ANSWER: ‚òëÔ∏è
      - This file is used by Git to keep track of files and directories
      - It's a binary containing
        - sorted list of path names, each with permissions
        - the SHA1 of a blob object
      - Represents the staging area
        - Git uses this file to efficiently determine what
        has changed in your working directory
        - If you delete or modify this file, you might
          - lose staged changes
          - disrupt Git's ability to track changes
- packed_refs

  - ```sh
      # pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled sorted 
      5208ffa362d587d32d0d68f4f2c5a3cd0b4a91c6 refs/heads/main

    ```

    - üÜó @udit-ok üÜó : What is this?
    - ANSWER: ‚òëÔ∏è
      - file contains references to objects in **packfiles**
      - **packfiles** are a space-efficient storage format for objects

      - **DUMBASS FIX** ... by force pushing to REMOTE NOOOO
        - `git remote -v`
          - origin  <https://github.com/miketon/JupyterJeep> (fetch)

##### B:Compare

- `git diff <first-branch-name>..<second-branch-name>`

##### B:Filter

- git-filter-branch
- allows you to go through your entire repository commit by
commit and make changes to each commit based on the
