    "\n",
    "1. **Batch size (`batch_size`):** The number of independent sequences processed  \n",

    "\n",
    "   - *Pros:*\n",
    "     - Larger batch sizes can lead to faster training as the model processes  \n",

    "     - Larger batch sizes can provide a better estimate of the gradient during  \n",

    "     - Sometimes, larger batch sizes can lead to worse generalization  \n",
    "     performance. Smaller batch sizes introduce more `noise in the gradient`  \n",
    "     updates, which can effectively act as a `form of regularization`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Block size (`block_size`):** The maximum context length for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *Pros:*\n",
    "     - Larger block sizes allow the model to learn longer-range dependencies in  \n",
    "     the text, which can potentially improve modeling performance.\n",
    "     - Larger block sizes can lead to better utilization of GPU resources, as  \n",

    "     gradients can have a harder time propagating through the entire sequence in  \n",
    "     the backpropagation process (vanishing/exploding gradient problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to strike a balance between these trade-offs when choosing  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Hardware limitations:** The GPU memory available on your system will limit  \n",

    "that can efficiently utilize the available resources without causing  \n",
    "out-of-memory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset size and complexity:** The size and complexity of your dataset can  \n",
    "affect the optimal batch size and block size. For larger and more complex  \n",
    "datasets, you may need to use larger block sizes to capture longer-range  \n",
    "dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model architecture:** The choice of model architecture can affect the  \n",
    "optimal batch size and block size. For example, some architectures like  \n",
    "`transformers can handle longer sequences more effectively` than recurrent  \n",

    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "- There is no notion of space.  Attention simply acts over a set of vectors.  This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.  `# TODO - is CONVOLUTION an IMPLICIT attention mechanism, where nearest neighbors are the IMPLICIT positional embedding`\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries.  In \"cross-attention\" the `???` get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just **delete the single line that does masking** with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. `???` here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings like `???` modeling.\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(`head_size`).  This makes is so when input Q,K are unit variance, `wei` will be `???` too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below `???`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explain Footnotes ^ like I am 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's break it down into simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention**: Imagine you're in a classroom where everyone is talking at once, and you want to focus on what your best friend is saying. You would \"pay more attention\" to the sounds coming from your friend, and less to the other noise. That's what the attention mechanism does - it pays more attention to the important parts of the data and less to the less important parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No notion of space**: Attention doesn't care about where things are in relation to each other. Imagine you are playing with a set of different toys - a car, a doll, a ball. You don't care where these toys are placed, you just play with each toy based on how much you like it. That's why we need to tell the model about the order of words in a sentence, because it doesn't understand this on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Each example is processed independently**: Think of it like doing your homework - you do each problem on its own, without mixing up the information from different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Self-attention and cross-attention**: Let's say you're trying to understand a story. If you think about the story and come up with questions and answers all by yourself, that's like self-attention. But if you get help from your teacher or a book (an external source) to understand the story, that's like cross-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encoder and decoder**: Imagine you're playing a game of telephone. The person who whispers the message into the next person's ear is like the encoder, and the person who tries to understand and pass along the message is like the decoder. In some cases, we allow all the players to talk to each other freely (like the encoder), and in others we only allow each player to hear from the players who spoke before them (like the decoder).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scaled attention**: Imagine you're sharing a pie with your friends. If you divide the pie evenly among everyone, each person only gets a small piece. But if you give a bigger piece to your best friend, you would have to make the other pieces smaller. Similarly, in scaled attention, we divide the attention \"pie\" among all the words in a sentence, but we give bigger \"pieces\" to the more important words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts with `???` are placeholders for information that should be filled in, based on the specific context or model that is being discussed.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Self-attention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention, also sometimes called intra-attention, is a mechanism that allows each token in an input sequence to look at the other tokens in the same sequence to get better context and thereby improve the representation of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified explanation: Imagine you're reading a book and you come across a sentence that says, \"Even though he was very tired, John decided to continue reading the book because it was so interesting.\" Now, if you want to understand who \"he\" is referring to in this sentence, you'll look at the other parts of the sentence, and realize that \"he\" is referring to \"John\". This is similar to what self-attention does - it allows a token to look at the other tokens in the sequence to get context and understand better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-attention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-attention, on the other hand, is a mechanism that allows each token in an input sequence to interact with tokens in a separate sequence. This is often used in tasks that involve pairs of sentences, like question answering or machine translation, where the model needs to understand the relationship between two different sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another simplified example: Imagine you're translating a sentence from English to Spanish. You come across the English word \"book\", which can be translated into Spanish as \"libro\". However, the exact translation might depend on the other words in the English sentence and their Spanish counterparts. So, you need to look at both the English sentence and the Spanish sentence you're constructing to decide on the best translation. This is similar to what cross-attention does - it allows a token in one sequence to look at the tokens in a different sequence to get additional context and improve the translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, self-attention and cross-attention are mechanisms that allow tokens to interact with each other to get better context and improve the model's understanding of the data. The difference between them lies in whether the tokens are looking at other tokens in the same sequence (self-attention) or a different sequence (cross-attention).\n",
